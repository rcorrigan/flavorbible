Big Data 2019 Final Project  
  
Contributers: Tina Liu, Michael Rendleman, Rae Corrigan  
Description: Our group will be using data from a cookbook called "The Flavor Bible." It describes what flavors go well together with various types of food. We will convert this information into a graph database. Since there are so many nodes and edges in the graph, one of the main components of the project will be experimenting with different indexing structures to minimize query time. Our goal is to create a web interface that allows users to select a food or flavor of interest and generate a map of complimentary flavors which can be visualized by the user.
